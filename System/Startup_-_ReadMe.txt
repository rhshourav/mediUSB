Instead of mounting boot.wim from mini windows 10 every time you want to
automatically start a program, file or .bat, just drag these into
/System/Startup.

NOTE: If you have not put anything in the folder, mini Windows 10 will
only launch default software such as PortableApps or Rainmeter. If you
have accidentally deleted this folder, you can create a System/Startup
folder as the default.
